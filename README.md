# PIG-GAME [ROLL THE DICE]

![image](/assets/game-img.jpg)

I have built a game using Javascript where 2 players can play together.<br/>
When player 1 rolls the dice, it creates a random number in dice between 1 to 6<br/>
and the score will be visible as a current score which can be held as well. <br/>
If the dice number comes as 1, then it is next player's turn, so if the current <br/>
player has not held their score then the user will lose the score.
When any one of the player hits 100 score, then that player wins.
